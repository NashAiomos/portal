# Overview
The ICP Rosetta allows for communication with the [ICP Ledger](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai) and the [NNS Governance Canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai) through the Rosetta-API standard. 
This guide is split up into the endpoints of the Data-API and that of the Construction-API.
